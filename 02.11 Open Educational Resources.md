## 11. Open Educational Resources (in progress)

### What is it?

Open Educational Resources are defined as teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others. Open educational resources include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation definition](https://www.hewlett.org/strategy/open-educational-resources/)].

### Rationale

In many cases educational resources are build upon research findings. If you are an Open Science practitioner it makes sense that your educational resources maintain the level of openness of your research. Moreover other instructors could use your material to elaborate new resources or adapt existing ones.

In fact the creation of educational resources can be seen as a cycle similar to the research cycle:

find, compose, adapt, use, and share

### Learning objectives

The main objective is to know how an educational resource can be open and learn that there is no a need to rebuild again any resource but the open some of the existing ones

Another objective is to know where to place your resources beyond the platforms addressed just to your students.
